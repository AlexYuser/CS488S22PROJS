q2 

If h1 wants to commmunicate with h4, I expect the latency to be around 170ms and the throughput to be around around 20mbits/second. 

The actual measured RTT/latency was 166ms which is really close to what I expected, I added up the RTT/latency of L1,2,3 because to communicate with from h1 to h4 you need to go through those and latency is measured by adding up the all latencies.

The measured throughput was measured to be 19.3mbits/second. It was very close to what I expected and the reason for this is because it doens't matter that much how fast the other two links are, they will be bottlenecked by the slowest bandwidth. In this case the bandwidths were 15, 21, and 28 mbits/second, the other two links are being slowed down by the 15mbits/second so the throughput will be higher than 15 and lower than 28 mbits/second so I guessed around 20 which was really close to the actual throghput. 

q3 

I expect the measured latency between pairs h1 and h4 and h7 and h9 to be roughly similar to the measured latency in q2 of 166ms, possibly around 160-166ms. I expect the throughput to be very slow for both pairs, lower than the slowest link of 15mbits/second, possibly around 10mbits/second. 

For 3 pairs I expect the same latency as 2 pairs but I expect the throughput or bandwidth of each pair to be even lower or slower than the throughput of 2 pairs. 

The h1-h4 pair had a average rtt of 165ms and a average thoughput of 15mbits/second and the h7-h9 pair had an average rtt of 164ms and average throughput of 8mbits/second. These were both within my expectations and the reason for this is because latency isn't affected by simultaneous communications but with bandwidth the links are being bottlenecked by the slowest link and with simultaneous communicaition the one pair is being sent through the link and the other pair is then stuck and bottlenecked by the other pair going through the slowest link. 

For the 3 pair simultaneous connection, h1-h4 had a average rtt of 167ms and average throughput of 11.1mbits/second. h7-h9 had a average rtt of 166ms and average throughput of 5.5 mbits/second. h10-h8 had a average rtt of 166ms and average throughput of 5.3 mbits/second. These measurements went like how I expected, latency barely changed because simultaneous communication does not really affect latency and the throughput was lowered even further because now all 3 pairs have to wait for eachother and they are bottlenecked by the slow link. 

q4

I expect the average rtt of pair h1-h4 to be around 164-168ms and have a average throughput of 15mbit/second. I expect the average rtt of pair h5-h6 to be around 45-53ms and have an average throughput of around 2-5 mbits/second

After measurement, the h1-h4 pair had a average rtt of 164ms and an average throughput of 13.9mbits/second and the h5-h6 pair had a average rtt of 45ms and a average throughput of 12.6 mbits/second. This is within my expectation, the latency doenst get affected by simultaneous communication and each pair would have their own numbers since they use different links thus having different added up latency values. But since the 2 pairs share a single link of L2 both throughputs will be slowed down a bit, not significantly but just a bit. the h1-h4 pair was slower than I anticipated and the h5-h6 pair was faster,  thought that the h5-6 pair would be slower due to the l4 link having a 2mbits/second bandwidth but I miscalculated since the other links L2 and L5 were significantly faster than L4 so it helped.
